# Spotify-Clone-Project
In this project I have used HTML & CSS to build the page of Spotify website and build the sidebar, playback controls menu & the album bar

# Future work
Further in this project I will be adding functionalities in this clone to play the music on pressing the play button & pause the music on clicking Pause button. I will also create the backend for the project 
so that the user can play the music of his choice.
